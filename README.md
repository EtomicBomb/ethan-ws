# ethan-ws

This is the server for my website, <a href="https://ethan.ws">https://ethan.ws</a>. It uses <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">axum</a>. 

The <a href="https://github.com/EtomicBomb/ethan_ws">server for my old website</a> was written directly on top of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html">TcpStream</a> in the standard library.
