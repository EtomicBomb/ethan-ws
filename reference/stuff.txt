# tutorial video
- Core gameplay
    - You win if you're the first person to shed all the cards in your hand.
    - You can put down cards on your turn, as long as your play is the same kind as
      the play on the table and it's higher than the play on the table
    - if at any time, you don't want to (or can't) put down cards, you can pass
    - If you put down something, and everyone else skips, then you can put down
      whatever you want on your turn
- What are the valid kinds of plays
    - Singles, pairs, and poker hands
- What does it mean for a play to be higher 
    - singles are higher if they have a higher number and a higher suit
        - numbers (rank) are ranked 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A, 2 (note: 3 lowest and 2 highest)
        - suits: club, spade, heart, diamond 
    - pairs ranked on the highest card in the pair
    - poker hand straights, flush, full house, four-of-a-kind (+trash), straight flush
        - ranked by the highest card, except for full house (ranked by highest in
          triple) and four-of-a-kind (ranked by highest in quad)
